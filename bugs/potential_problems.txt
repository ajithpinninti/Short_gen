0) script sentence completion detection is correct need to check.
1) subtitle position should be customized, currently it's not changing it's position
2) subtitles style should be editable with outline black
3) for some letters susbtitles are cutting in down side, it should be fully visible
4) compare number of images and lines and not proceed if not same
need to check how to increase the box size to add subtitles as overlay


Note:-
if folder contains anything other than images ignore those

match number of words in script and  words detected remove all the annotation in both
based on that seperate the sentece timing of the image.
audio need to speedup without decreasing the quality, or video directly 
without decreasing the quality if finding the words become problem with whsiper
