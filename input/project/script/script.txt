At dusk on Kurukshetra, a shattered battlefield whispers the sorrow of war.
Here lies Bheeshma, serene upon a lethal bed of arrows a monument to sacrifice.
In silent meditation, his scarred face reflects ancient battles and divine resolve.
All around, warriors and Arjuna gaze, hearts torn between duty and grief.
As twilight yields to dawn, his soul ascends in radiant liberation, transcending mortal strife.
