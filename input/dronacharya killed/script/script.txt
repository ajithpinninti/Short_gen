and shouted, “Ashwatthama is dead.”
Drona did not believe it and asked Yudhishthira, who always spoke the truth.
Yudhishthira said, “Ashwatthama is dead,” but quietly added, “an elephant, not your son.”
Drona heard only the first part and was heartbroken, He dropped his weapons in grief.
Dhrishtadyumna saw his chance and killed the unarmed Drona, keeping his vow of revenge.
Dronacharya was defeated not by strength, but by a clever plan.
